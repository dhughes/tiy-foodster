This is the results from a crash course that was created by [Lexi Namer](https://github.com/lexinamer) and myself to demonstrate the developer-designer workflow. For this crash course we stood on either side of the classroom and bounced the lecture back and forth. She would demonstrate how she would apply CSS and HTML styling, I would demonstrate how her static code could be connected to a Java and Spring backend. We used Github collaboration to share files and demonstrate that part of the workflow too.

It was easily our best-received crash course. To see the materials we prepared, check out the [tiy-developer-designer-crashcourse repository](https://github.com/dhughes/tiy-developer-designer-crashcourse).
